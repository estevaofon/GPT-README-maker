## About

This code creates a command-line interface tool to generate a README file for a Python codebase. It does this by summarizing the input code using OpenAI's GPT-3 API, extracting necessary libraries from the code, and inferring usage instructions using another API endpoint. It then generates a README file with the summarized code, library requirements, usage instructions, and a contribution message.

## Requirements

To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage

python <name of the file>.py <file_path>
